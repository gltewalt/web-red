                <p class="text-grey-darker">Download the correct Red binary version for your computer from here (takes only a few seconds, it's less than 1MB). Save into a suitable folder.
<br><br>
                    For Windows users: Run it by double-clicking on the Red binary file.<br> 
                    It will then automatically build the Red GUI-console.<br>
                   Next time you double-click on the file, the GUI-console will automatically open.
<br> <br>                   
For Linux/OSX users: You need to open a terminal app to be able to run Red. <br>
                    Once you have opened the terminal app, change to the directory in which you saved Red. <br>
                    Now do a: chmod u+x <red-binary> which will make sure that Red can be run on your computer. <br>
                    After that, run Red using ./<red-binary>. This will build the Red console. <br>
                    Next time you run Red, the console will automatically open.</p>
