    heading: "Red: The World's First Full-Stack Programming Language"
    content: |-
        By full-stack, we mean one common language base to code anything,
        from metal to meta. With both a REPL and a self-contained
        toolchain, it's easy to get started. One EXE. Drop and go.<br><br>
        
        Platform-native GUIs, DSLs, code generators, libraries, device
        drivers, an OS, decentralized apps...anything you can imagine,
        using a single, homoiconic language.<br><br>
        
        Our mission is to fight complexity and bloat using concise,
        elegantly powerful code.

    heading: "Abstraction on Every Level"
    content: |-
      Red is more than just a language. It's a language construction set.
      Whether youâ€™re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application,
      or a shared library, Red's flexibility lets you use a common syntax to
      code at the right level of abstraction for the task. <br><br>
      
      Some dialects (a.k.a embedded DSLs) are already built in, to show you
      how it's done. There's one for writing GUIs, another for vector drawing,
      a PEG-like parsing dialect, and even Red/System, the system (C) level
      language is a dialect.

    heading: "RED Tokens on the Blockchain"
    content: |-
      Coming in 2020, Red/C3 will be your new best friend on the blockchain,
      for smart contracts and decentralized apps. It is being designed to 
      provide cross-chain smart contracts, just as Red is cross-platform for
      native apps. We hope to build a new economic model to better support
      open source project communities, which may be used later by other open
      source teams.<br><br>

      Red's domain-specific languages and ease of use make it a revolutionary
      new tool for the decentralized web! Less vulnerable to exploit than
      Solidity, it eliminates many attack vectors. Want the limitations off?
      C3 can still provide increased safety, close to that provided by
      templates, but with greater flexibility.

    heading: "The Red Foundation is Making It Easier to Build Amazing Products."
    content: |-
      Funding Open Source work is hard, but Red has a non-profit foundation
      behind it to help. Contributors are compensated for their efforts today,
      and we hope to do more in the future. Bounties, not just for bugs, but
      documentation, testing, and even community support. Much of this will be
      facilitated through tokenomics on the blockchain. It's a brave new world.
