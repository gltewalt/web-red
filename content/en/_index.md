        Red is building a full-stack, "metal to meta," open-source toolchain. <br><br>
        
        
        By full-stack, we mean one common language base to code anything, from system programming tasks up to high-level scripting. <br><br>
        
        A device driver, a library, a platform-native GUI tool, an OS, decentralized apps ... Red writes anything you can imagine, using domain-specific, homoiconic language.

    heading: "Abstraction on Every Level"
    content: |-
      Red is more like a "language construction set" than simply "a language." Whether youâ€™re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application, or a shared library, Red's flexibility lets you use a common syntax to code at the right level of abstraction for the task.

    heading: "RED Tokens on the Blockchain"
    content: |-
      Red is your tool for interacting with the community of smart contracts and decentralized apps, and is being designed to provide easy cross-chain transactions. We hope to build a new economic model to better support open source project communities, which may be used later by other open source teams. Using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization enabled by our ERC-20-compliant Red Community Token (RED), these tokens are slated to provide privileges like voting rights, bug fixes, and microtipping.

    content: |-
      Red's domain-specific languages and ease of use make it a revolutionary new tool for the decentralized web! Less vulnerable to exploit than Solidity, its few limitations eliminate a LOT of possible attack vectors. Want the limitations off? We have a high-level DSL that still provides increased safety, close to the level provided by templates, with greater flexibility.
