I have been invited at the Software Freedom Day 2011 (September 14th) to give a talk about Red. Here are the presentation [slides](http://static.red-lang.org/Red-SFD2011-45mn.pdf) and the video.

I am not a great speaker, so you might want to go through the slides first, and eventually have a look at my corresponding comments in the video (it is too long anyway). I need to make shorter and faster presentations in the future.
