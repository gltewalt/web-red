Red/System Mac OS X port is now completed and on par with Windows and Linux ports. The new Mach-O file emitter supports all current Red/System's features including [#syscall](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-9.2) and [#import](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-9.1) directives.

Now that all major 3 OS are supported, I can say that the Mac OS X [file ABI](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html) and [function call ABI](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/130-IA-32_Function_Calling_Conventions/IA32.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002492-SW4) are really the most complicated one to support from scratch, the Windows one ([PE/COFF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463119)) being the simplest (with its own set of oddities, but simpler) and Linux's [ELF](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/elf/) somewhere in between. Among the issues we had to identify and deal with:

- Stack alignment on 16 bytes constraint at the point of every library call (meet with the infamous ["gate keeper"](http://blogs.embarcadero.com/eboling/2009/05/20/5607) code causing segfaults and bus errors on misaligned calls)

- Extra stack entry for each [BSD system call](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/developers-handbook/book.html#X86-SYSTEM-CALLS).

- Working around dynamically linked libraries [info extraction](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001298-dylib) that need to be copied from each library header to the generated executable image. This could have prevented cross-compilation.

- The need for direct CALL opcode in the generated IA-32 code instead of indirect ones used for PE and ELF library function callings.

As you can see, it is fully functional and all unit tests are passing!

A couple of notes about usage:

- The library you declare in #import definition needs to be located in /usr/lib/ or else, you need to provide a full path to the library.

- The file emitter should support up to 255 imported libraries (Mach-O limit), but it has been tested only with one so far (libc.dylib), so if you have anything odd happening with more than one imported library, please fill a bug report in [github's tracker](https://github.com/red/Red/issues), or post a message to the mailing-list.
