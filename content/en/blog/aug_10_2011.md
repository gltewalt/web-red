This new release is bringing a lot of important bug fixes and some new features for Red/System. The new PRINT function might break some existing scripts, but should be easily fixable.

## New features

- Variable-arguments function [support](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-6.3.3)

- [RTTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information) function limited [support](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-6.3.4)

- Polymorphic and variadic [PRINT](https://github.com/red/Red/blob/master/red-system/runtime/utils.reds) function

- Command-line arguments [access](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-13.6
)
- Added stack low-level manipulation native [functions](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-13.4): `push`, `pop`

- [Access](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-13.6.4) to stack pointer and stack frame pointer (reading/writing)

- Subtracting two pointers is now possible

- Preprocessor improved to solve macros recursively

- New built-in hexdump debugging [functions](http://groups.google.com/group/red-lang/browse_thread/thread/328574b2a776f24?hl=en)

- External library access unit tests (thanks to Peter)  


PRINT function examples:

```
print 123
123
```

```
print "hello"
hello
```

```
print [123 "hello"]
123hello
```

```
print [123 tab "hello" lf "world" lf]
123 hello
world
```

```
a: 1 < 2
b: "hello"
print [a tab b/2]
true e
```

## Bugfixes

- Complex arithmetic expressions involving pointers, path access and type casting are now much more reliable. [89 new unit tests](https://github.com/red/Red/blob/master/red-system/tests/source/units/math-mixed-test.reds) were written to help fix the bugs and track regressions.

- Complete list of fixed issues available in [Github's tracker](https://github.com/red/Red/issues?milestone=1&state=closed).


## Specification document

- Updated to match all new and changed features


## Red runtime

- Memory allocator [implemented](https://github.com/red/Red/blob/master/red/runtime/allocator.reds) in Red/System, documentation is pending.


As you can see, no vacation this summer for Red project!
