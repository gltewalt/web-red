Three months have passed since Red has gone public. It seems short, but a lot happened since then and I wanted to sum up the work accomplished for the people interested in Red that don't have the time to follow the progress daily on every channel.

## Development

- Red/System is implemented at 98%
- ~2600 unit tests were created (thanks to Peter WA Wood)
- Red/System language [specification draft](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html) added, now close to 95% of completion
- Code base almost doubled: 60KB to 110KB (~3200 LOC)
- 164 commits on Github, 44 by contributors
- 4600+ page views on Github's [Red repository](https://github.com/red/Red)


## Main new features

- New datatypes: `byte!`, `logic!`, `pointer!`
- Linux port (thanks to Andreas Bolka)
- [Syllable](http://development.syllable.org/news/2011-05-28-00-37-First-Red-program-on-SyllableDesktop.html) port (thanks to Andreas and Kaj)
- MacOS X port in progress


## Community

- 0MQ library support (Kaj de Vos)
- Quick-Test framework (Peter WA Wood)
- 3 contributors on Github, 22 followers
- 65 issues opened on Github, 53 closed (thanks to Rudolf Meijer)
- 8 blog posts, 10'000+ page views
- [#red_lang](http://twitter.com/#red_lang): 130 tweets, 39 followers
- Mailing-list: 32 members, 45 topics, 150 posts
- IRC: 5 people permanently logged


Last but not least, we got an article on [OSNews](http://www.osnews.com/story/24798/New_Red_Programming_Language_Gets_Syllable_Backend) two days ago that boosted the page views on red-lang.org (+3'000) and Github's repo (+1'000).

Thanks for all people supporting Red, one way or another. This is a very good start and a big incentive for me to work even harder on the next steps.
