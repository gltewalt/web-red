This release is mainly a bugfix release that solves several old issues. It is also now correctly synchronized with all the current bindings done for Red/System. The main changes are:

- Internal compiler refactoring of: expressions compilation, type casting and ANY/ALL support.

- Greatly improved runtime error reporting: now it reports both source line number and source file name where the error occured. It works in debug mode only (-g command-line option).

- Aliased struct names can now be [tested separately](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-13.6.7) in typed (RTTI) functions.

- Callback function attribute removed. It is no more needed and any function can now be used as a callback. In addition a new [cdecl](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html#section-6.3.2) attribute is now accepted to allow the switch to C calling convention, when passing a function as argument to an imported C function.

- [21 issue reports](https://github.com/red/Red/issues?milestone=2&state=closed) closed.
More than 2000 new unit tests were added (mostly generated using scripts wrote by Peter WA Wood) for a total of now 8613 tests.
