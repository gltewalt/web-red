We set up the Red Foundation structure at the beginning of January in Paris, France. The Red Foundation is kindly hosted by the EPHE, at the Human and Artificial Cognition research unit led by Fran√ßois Jouen (author of the famous RedCV framework, among other image-processing related projects for Red).

For a brief overview, the Red Foundation structure is composed of several teams:

- an administrative team: 

    * Nenad Rakocevic, President

    * Francois Jouen, Vice-President

    * Azouz Guizani, Treasurer

* An operational team, led by [Gregg Irwin](https://github.com/greggirwin), and composed of regular members. [Peter W A Wood](https://github.com/peterwawood) is the first member, and will be followed by more in the future.

* Honorary members, who act as advisors.


The role of the Foundation, as explained in the [announcement article](http://www.red-lang.org/2017/12/leaping-into-future-red-goes-blockchain.html) and in the [RED whitepaper](https://ico.red-lang.org/RED-whitepaper.pdf), is to manage the whole Red open source project, and set up a new economic model for open source projects using the RED token. In order to achieve that, all copyright holders in the Red codebase on Github will be asked to transfer their rights to the Foundation. As Nenad is the copyright owner of the biggest part of the source code, he will be the first one to do so (resulting in changing the copyright in the source files headers and license files).

The tasks the operational team is also working on currently, are:

* a website for the Foundation, featuring:
    * a blog platform where regular reports will be made.
    * full information about the RED token (usages, reward rules and amounts).
    * contributing task bounties for the Red community (paid in RED tokens).


* defining the rules for retro-distribution of RED tokens for past contributions (since the opening of the Red github repo in 2011). We will proceed with the distribution as soon as the rules and correct amount of reward tokens are decided. This needs the list of contributions and contributors to be gathered.

* defining the decision processes in the operational team.

* defining the rules for membership of the Foundation.

* managing the re-design of the red-lang.org site and moving it to a new platform.


All those tasks and their results will be published on the Foundation website, for the sake of information and transparency.

In order to absorb all these new tasks and the extended roadmaps for the new branches of development in the Red programming stack, we are recruiting new collaborators (non-exhaustive list):

* a Content and Marketing Manage
* a Community manager (to help Gregg)
* a [devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) lead (for deployment and infrastructures management)
* a low-level system programmer (to reinforce the core Red dev team)
* an Android system programmer
* a Win32 system programmer (for maintaining the Windows backend)
* a Cocoa system programmer (for maintaining the macOS backend)
* a GTK system programmer (for maintaining the Linux backend)
* a QA engineer
* a Security Expert (for addressing the AV vendors issues and other security aspects in the project)
* a Tokenomics Expert (if such rare bird even exists ;-))


Some of those jobs are already being filled as you read those lines, whilst it might take longer to find right match for others. Most of those jobs will be handled by our supporting company, Fullstack Technology, on behalf of the Foundation. We will post the job descriptions asap.

In addition to that, the Red Foundation is searching for partners helping it fulfill his vision of simplified programming solutions for humans, especially in the blockchain industry. Discussions are undergoing already with some potential partners, like the [NEO council](https://neo.org/), or [Enuma](https://www.enuma.io/index.html), a leading blockchain services company in Hong Kong.

The Foundation will set up a monthly report on all its activities, published on his website (under construction).
