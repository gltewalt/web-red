We are pleased to announce that Red/System [v0.2.3](https://github.com/red/Red/tags) is out, extending Red to the mobile world with a complete support for Linux on ARMv5+ processors. The new port supports 100% of Red/System features and passes successfully the 8537 unit tests.

For those of you interested in more details, our ARM port targets the v5 family, with 32-bit instructions (no Thumb support) and optional literals pools (use -l or --literal-pool command-line option when compiling) that implement a global allocation strategy (unlike gcc's function-local allocations).

New compilation targets have been provided for Linux and derivative OS running on ARM:

- Linux-ARM
- Android


Android support is using the same code as Linux-ARM, only differing in libc and dynamic linker names.

Currently, as Red/System only works on command-line in Android, you need a special loader to download the executable and run it. This can be achieved using the [NativeExe app](http://gimite.net/en/index.php?Run%20native%20executable%20in%20Android%20App). You will need to allow temporary installing apps from non market sources (Settings > Applications > Unknown sources). Also, your local 3G provider might be filtering out executables downloaded this way, you can workaround that by either manually loading the NativeExe-0.2.apk file with [adb](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#move), or share a wired Internet connection with your mobile device.

You can easily install NativeExe app by just typing the following URL in your Android web browser:

http://gimite.net/archive/NativeExe-0.2.apk

or by scanning this QR-code instead:

Once done, input in the second field: http://sidl.fr/red/hello and hit [Run]. 


Here are a few screenshots of HelloWorld tests:

Andreas has also [reported](http://twitter.com/#!/xearl/status/138413355126886400/photo/1) that it's working fine on Nokia N9 devices.


## Supporting Android and iOS API

The next steps to enable building full apps on Android and iOS are:

1. Support [PIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) compilation mode: indirect access to all global variables and data. This is a requirement for building shared libraries on UNIX (but optional on Windows).
    
2. Add __shared library__ generation to file format emitters. This will require some new compilation directives to mark the exported code parts.
    
3. Build a __bridge__ with Java for Android and Objective-C for iOS/OSX. This generic bridge would allow accessing all the objects and methods of the host and send back to Red all I/O events.


Such approach will allow us to build easily Android or iOS apps without having to write a single line of Java or Objective-C code, while providing the full power of  Red. At least, that's the theory, we'll see in practice if it's up to our expectations. Also, cross-compilation should be fully available for Android (producing Android apps from any OS), but code signing and app publishing requirements might make it impossible for iOS and require a MacOS X with Xcode for producing apps (if you know workarounds, let us know).

The PIC support should be doable in a few days, the support for shared library generation might take a bit more time. Anyway, theses tasks will need to be multiplexed with Red runtime & compiler implementation, so don't expect significant progress before a month.

In the meantime, you are welcome to test the ARM port of Red/System and hack Android and upcoming [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) devices using it. ;-)

Cheers!
