## Source Navigation

As requested by several users, I am giving a little more insights on the Red/System compiler inner workings and a map for navigating in the source code.

Current Red/System source tree:

    red-system/
        %compiler.r        ; Main compiler code, loads everything else
        %emitter.r         ; Target code emitter abstract layer
        %linker.r          ; Format files loader
        %rsc.r             ; Compiler's front-end for standalone usage

    formats/               ; Contains all supported executable formats
        %PE.r              ; Windows PE/COFF file format emitter
        %ELF.r             ; UNIX ELF file format emitter

    library/               ; Third-party libraries

    runtime/               ; Contains all runtime definitions
        %common.reds       ; Cross-platform definitions
        %win32.r           ; Windows-specific bindings
        %linux.r           ; Linux-specific bindings

    targets/               ; Contains target execution unit code emitters
        %target-class.r    ; Base utility class for emitters
        %IA32.r            ; Intel IA32 code emitter

    tests/                 ; Unit tests


Once the compiler code is loaded in memory, the objects hierarchy looks like:

    system/words/          ; global REBOL context

    system-dialect/        ; main object
        loader/            ; preprocessor object
            process        ; preprocessor entry point function
        compiler/          ; compiler object
            compile        ; compiler entry point function

    emitter/               ; code emitter object
        compiler/         ; short-cut reference to compiler object
        target/           ; reference the target code emitter object
            compiler/     ; short-cut reference to compiler object

    linker/                ; executable file emitter
        PE/                ; Windows PE/COFF format emitter object
        ELF/               ; UNIX ELF format emitter object



__Note__: the linker file formats are currently statically loaded, this will be probably changed to a dynamic loading model.

## Compilation Phases

The compilation is a process that goes through several phases to transform a textual source code to an executable file. Here is an overview of the process:

![Compilation](/images/blog/compilation-process.png)

### 1) Source loading

This is a preparatory phase that would convert the text source code to its memory representation (close to an [AST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)). This is achieved in 3 steps:

1. source is preprocessed in its text form to make the syntax REBOL-compatible
2. source is converted to a tree of nested blocks using the REBOL's LOAD function
3. source is postprocessed to interpret some compiler directives (like #include and #define)

### 2) Compilation

The compiler walks through the source tree using a [recursive descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) parser. It attempts to match keywords and values with its internal rules and emits:

- the corresponding machine code in the code buffer
- the global variables and complex data (c-string! and struct! literals) in the data buffer

The internal entry point function for the compilation is compiler/comp-dialect. All the compiler/comp-* functions are used to recursively analyze the source code and each one matches a specific semantic rule (or set of rules) from the Red/System language [specification](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html).

The production of [native code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_code) is direct, there is no intermediary representation, machine code is generated as soon as a language statement or expression is matched. This is the simplest way to do it, but code cannot be efficiently optimised without a proper [Intermediate Representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) (IR). When Red/System will be rewritten in Red, a simple IR will be introduced to enable the full range of possible code optimisations.

As you know, a Red/System program entry point is at the beginning of the source code. During the compilation, the source code in the global context is compiled first and all functions are collected and compiled after all global code. So the generated code is always organised the same way:

-global code (including proper program [finalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_code))
    
- function 1
    
- function 2
- ...

The results of the compilation process are:

- a global [symbol table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table)
- a machine code buffer
- a global data buffer
- a list of functions from external libraries (usually these are OS API mappings)

The compiler is able to process one or several source files this way before entering the linking phase.

### 3) Linking

The linking process goal is to create an executable file that could be loaded by the target platform. So the executable file needs to conform to the target [ABI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) for that, like [PE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) for Windows or [ELF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) for Linux.

During the linking, the global symbol table is used to "patch" the code and data buffer (see linker/resolve-symbol-refs), inserting the final memory address for the pointed resources (variable, function, global data). The different parts to assemble are grouped into so-called "sections", that can be themselves be grouped into "segments" (as, e.g., in ELF).

Finally, some headers describing the file and its sections/segments are inserted to complete the file. The file is then written down on disk, marking the end of the whole process.

Static linking of external libraries (*.lib, *.a,...) will be added at some point in the future (when the need for such feature will appear).


I hope this short description gives you a better picture on how Red/System compiler works, even if it is probably obvious for the most experienced readers. Feel free to ask for more in the comments, or better, on the Google Groups [mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/red-lang?hl=en).
