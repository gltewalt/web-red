This is a major milestone reached on the Red [roadmap](/roadmap/). Red/System is now in a beta state, which means that it is good enough, both in design and implementation to be used for building applications.

A huge collective effort has been made by all contributors to reach that state during June, in a single month, we produced:

- 190 new commits (total = 354 now), more in a month than in the three previous ones!
- 3600 more unit tests (total = 6230 now)
- 2800 more LOC (total ~ 6000 LOC now)
- 70 issues closed on github's [tracker]
- 8 more revisions of specification document

This is what can be called an "intense" month of work!<br><br>

There are still a lot of features that are lurking in the corner for inclusion. Red/System features are not set in stone, the language will evolve to match our needs, as a support tool for building Red. It will now follow a bit more organized release cycle to help users and contributors have a more stable base to work with.

The version number has been bumped to v0.2.0. From now on, only non-disruptive changes will be pushed on the main branch, other changes will go into a separate development branch until we decide to make a new release, merge new features and increment the version number. This cycle should be short, on a weekly basis (each week or two, depending on the development branch content). If this organization does not fit well the development progress, we will adapt to a more adequate one.

I cannot resist to show you the new unit testing output when running the complete tests suite (just run the %tests/run-all.r script):
