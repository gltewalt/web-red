      Red is a full-stack (metal to meta), open-source toolchain. It's a relatively new, general-to-granular programming language created by Nenad Rakocevic, developed as an open-source project since 2011. By full stack, we mean you can use one common language base to write anything: a device driver, a shared library, a platform-native GUI application, a client, an OS, decentralized apps...anything you can envision.

      Other languages talk about having "one tool to rule them all". Red has that mindset too, pushed to the limit - it's a single executable that takes in your source files on any platform, and produces a packaged binary for any platform, from any other. The tool doesn't depend on anything besides what came with your OS...shipping as a single executable that's smaller than a megabyte.

      It uses human-friendly syntax, like 31-Jan-2018/16:00+8:00 for dates, which, for example, is 1517385600 in epoch seconds, for those of you wearing an epoch seconds watch. Its interactive read-eval-print loop allows you to construct your own self-informing code, checking your work as you go, and offers a rich set of built-in datatypes (over 50).
